# statistical-learning
In this project we investigated whether the choice of chunking vs transitional probabilities depended on the statistical properties of the to-learn pattern. We analysed this through the relative fit of normative Bayesian models.


To recreate the posterior distribution images found in the paper, simply run main.py.
The different Bayesian learners used in the study are described in the Model_X.py files.

## Folders
data		- Contains the csv files of the participant data. By default, these are comma-separated.
results		- Contains both the images and files generated by main.py. The general results start with 'general'. If the folder does not exist,
				running main.py will create the file.
